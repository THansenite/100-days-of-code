# Projects and Priorities

1. Grain Price App
Web scrape the local COOP site for recent grain prices and display them (in an app?)

2. Deck Analysis Tool
Be able to scrape top decks in a format and aggregate the decklists to see what cards are always or commonly used.  Also able to cross reference within my inventory to see what pieces I need or what decks I can almost make.  Similar to http://mtgtop8.com and their compare feature.

3. Smart Mirror
Start building app for upstairs smart mirror.

4. AR Build App
App for building a cheap AR where you can enter prices of various components, groups of components, etc. and have it tell you the most economical way to purchase everything.

5. DMAHockey Rewrite with Laravel
Yet another rewrite of DMAHockey, this time using MVC and the Laravel framework.
